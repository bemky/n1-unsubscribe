- **use_browser**: Toggle between opening web-based unsubscribe links in your native browser or an in-app pop-up window (default: pop-up).
- **handle_threads**: Toggle between automatically archiving, trashing or not moving your email anywhere after unsubscibing (default: archive).
- **confirm_for_email**: Toggle a confirmation box on or off before sending an automatic unsubscribe email (default: off).
- **confirm_for_browser**: Toggle a confirmation box on or off before opening a browser window to unsubscribe from an email (default: off).

More documentation of these toggles is available in the settings file.

## Behind the Scenes

We use the list-unsubscribe header that is invisibly attached to most marketing emails. If there is no header, we scour the email body for an unsubscribe link or a phrase describing how to unsubscribe. Once a link is found, either an automated email will be sent or a mini browser will appear that will allow you to quickly unsubscribe without leaving N1. The email is trashed for you once this completes. An important note, if no unsubscribe action is available, the button will be hidden.

<!--#### Bulk Action-->

<!--(To Be Developed)-->

#### Quick Action

From the comfort of your inbox view, you can easily unsubscribe from an email by tapping the new icon alongside the trash and archive buttons that you are used to. If no unsubscribe action is available, the button will be hidden.

#### Menu Item

While reading an email you may realize that you would like to unsubscribe, so instead of scrolling to the bottom of the email and playing the *spot the unsubscribe link game*, which is [an actual game](http://spottheunsubscribe.tumblr.com/), you can press the obvious button at the top.
